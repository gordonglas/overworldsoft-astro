My son wants to make his own Roblox game, so I started learning Roblox development.

Roblox already has great tools and infrastructure to create a game.
They handle so much for you:
* 3D game editor
* Lua-based scripting language
* Multiplayer-first, managed-server architecture
* Built-in monetization
* and much more...

When I actually first started learning it awhile back, the documentation and tutorials were kinda all over the place, but today, [Roblox now has some great tutorials](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/onboarding) and there are good books available, including [Coding Roblox Games Made Easy](https://www.packtpub.com/product/coding-roblox-games-made-easy/9781800561991), which is what I've been using.

My son has been helping by making models within Roblox Studio. He recently turned 8 years old and can do this easily.

More to come on our development later.
